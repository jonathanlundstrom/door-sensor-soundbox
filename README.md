# Door Sensor Soundbox

This project aims to create a simple sound player which triggers whenever a door has been opened to play some fun introduction sounds. It's based on a Raspberry Pi, a magnetic switch and some other low-cost and accessible hardware pieces. Of course, anyone could go ahead and buy something mass produced, but it's always more fun to build stuff yourself.I got the idea a while back from seeing a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8D8YjgnGR4) where this guy had created a custom door opening sensor that would play the iconic bass riffs from Seinfeld whenever the door opened. Seeing as how I love technology I figured it would make a good addition to my office, so I built an enhanced version. This is the resulting project.

This project was developed in partnership with [Conrad](https://www.conrad.se/) in their efforts to showcase makers around Sweden. I would therefore like to thank them for providing the hardware used in this project. Please also check out [their website](http://tekkie.se/) for more interesting projects.
